# Bioinformatics
A repository to store personal answers to Rosalind.info bioinformatics problems

Each problem will have a .py file and corresponding dataset file following same naming.
The first one is rosalind_dna.py and rosalind_dna.txt. I also include Rosalind.info link in .py file for specific problem for reference!
